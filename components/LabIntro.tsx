        The <strong>Data Interaction and Visualization Lab</strong>, in short{" "}
        <strong>DIV-Lab</strong> is an interdisciplinary research laboratory
        located in the School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma,
        Norman. We specialize in Data Visualization, Perception and Cognition
        Science, Computer Graphics, and applied Artificial Intelligence. Our
        primary focus is on creating visual representations and interfaces that
        enhance understanding, interaction, and development of computational
        models. The DIV-Lab explores the intersection of data science, visual
        cognition, and computer graphics in order to understand how people make
        sense of visual information, and then leverage that knowledge to design
        innovative visualization systems that drive discovery across a wide
        range of domains, from psychology to communication to topology. Our
        ultimate mission is to facilitate the dialog between people and
        technologies, enabling discovery and advancing the state of the art in
        visual design and data interpretation. Through close collaboration with
        scholars and researchers, we strive to create interfaces and tools that
        empower users to explore, analyze, and gain valuable insights from
        complex data.

            At DIV-Lab, our research on constructing optimal{" "}
            <strong>visualization design</strong> focuses on developing{" "}
            <strong>visualization frameworks</strong> that align visual
            encoding, task demands, and design choices to enhance data
            interpretation and <strong>decision-making</strong>. We aim to
            bridge the gap between abstract design guidelines and real-world
            applications by creating{" "}
            <strong>task-optimized visualizations</strong>—designs tailored to
            support specific analytical goals with greater clarity and
            efficiency. We build tools and frameworks that produce more precise,
            less ambiguous data presentations by systematically studying the
            interplay between visualization types, low-level tasks, and encoding
            strategies. This leads to improved performance, greater decision
            confidence, and more robust, scalable{" "}

            At DIV-Lab, our Human-Centered Computing and Interfaces research
